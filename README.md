Demos using [eosjs](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosjs) and the `greymassfuel` account to cosign transactions.

The repository shows an example for the various versions of eosjs in the wild.

- v16.0.9
- v20.0.0

Within each folder there are two files:

- *browser-example.js*: Showing how to craft a transaction within the browser.
- *server-example.js*: Showing how to craft a transaction within a server side script.
